## Overview

This project explores the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for predicting income levels. The goal is to create a model that estimates whether an individual’s income is `<=50K` or `>50K` based on several features such as age, education, hours worked, and capital gains.

The Jupyter notebook provides the implementation, step-by-step data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following features:

- **age**: The age of the individual.
- **education.num**: Number of years of education completed by the individual.
- **capital.gain**: Capital gains income of the individual.
- **hours.per.week**: Number of hours the individual works per week.
- **income**: The target variable representing income class (`<=50K` or `>50K`).

### Example of Dataset:

| age | education.num | capital.gain | hours.per.week | income |
|-----|---------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| 90  | 9             | 0            | 40             | <=50K  |
| 82  | 9             | 0            | 18             | <=50K  |
| 66  | 10            | 0            | 40             | <=50K  |
| 54  | 4             | 0            | 40             | <=50K  |
| 41  | 10            | 0            | 40             | <=50K  |

Make sure to preprocess and clean the dataset before feeding it into the model.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/salary-estimation-knn.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. You can run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Salary_EstimationwithKNN.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook includes data cleaning, missing value handling, and feature encoding steps.

2. **Model Training**: The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is used for classification, where we aim to predict whether an individual’s income is `<=50K` or `>50K`.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. **Prediction**: After training, the model can predict the income class for a new set of inputs (age, education, etc.).

## Model Explanation

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A supervised learning algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure. For income classification, it looks at the 'K' nearest neighbors and classifies based on the majority class of the neighbors.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated based on the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positives to all actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
